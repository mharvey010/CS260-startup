# Reaction

[My Notes](notes.md)

Reaction is a game of testing your reaction time. Users log in and can start a game. A button is presented to the user and once the color of the button changes, they press the button. The application logs the time it took to press the button. The times are compared to other user's times which are displayed on a leaderboard. The user will also have the option to change the colors of the button.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Reaction is a simple game. Be faster than everyone else. Once you start the game, you are presented with a button on your screen with a color of your choice. Pay close attention, because as soon as the color changes, you need to press it as fast as you can. Log in and compete with other players for the number one spot as the fastest there is.
